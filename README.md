# Digital Campfire

Transform today's news headlines into personalized Skinny poems with AI assistance. A meditative creative writing experience that helps you find reflection in our information-saturated world.

## What is Digital Campfire?

Digital Campfire is a lightweight creative writing gadget that transforms current news headlines into poetic "whispers" and helps you craft personalized Skinny poems. Rather than being just another AI poem generator, it's designed as a contemplative space where strangers can sit by the fire and share one line of feeling through AI-assisted creative writing.

## Features

- **News-to-Poetry Transformation**: Real-time conversion of Guardian RSS headlines into poetic phrases
- **Skinny Poem Generation**: AI-assisted creation of 11-line structured poems with repeated anchor words
- **Interactive Creative Process**: Step-by-step guided experience for selecting whispers, anchors, and expressing feelings
- **Live Editing**: Edit and refine your generated poems while maintaining Skinny poem structure
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, campfire-themed interface that works across all devices
- **Dark/Light Themes**: Toggle between warm campfire aesthetics for day and night

## What are Skinny Poems?

Skinny poems are a unique poetic form with a specific 11-line structure:
- Lines 1 & 11: Same phrase or variation (the "whisper")
- Lines 2, 6, 10: Repeated anchor word
- Lines 3-5, 7-9: Single words that build meaning through simplicity

The format encourages brevity and precision, creating a meditative, mantra-like quality through repetition.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a Whisper**: Select from poetic interpretations of today's news headlines
2. **Pick an Anchor**: Choose a word that will repeat throughout your poem
3. **Share Your Feeling**: Optionally express what you're carrying today
4. **Receive Your Poem**: Watch as AI crafts a Skinny poem from your choices
5. **Make It Yours**: Edit and refine the poem to match your voice

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom campfire-themed design
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactions
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo for content generation
- **News Source**: The Guardian RSS feed for real-time headlines
- **Deployment**: Netlify with serverless functions
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

## Developer Features

### Source Indicators

If you look closely at the interface, you'll notice tiny colored dots throughout the application. These subtle indicators help developers understand the source of generated content:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Green dots**: Content successfully generated by OpenAI's API
- **ðŸŸ  Orange dots**: Content generated by fallback systems when OpenAI is unavailable

These indicators are intentionally subtle - part of the interface's aesthetic while providing valuable insight for developers and curious users.

### API Endpoints

The application uses several Netlify Functions for AI processing:

- `/api/transform-headline` - Converts news headlines to poetic phrases
- `/api/generate-anchors` - Creates sets of anchor words for poems
- `/api/generate-poem` - Generates complete Skinny poems
- `/api/validate-poem` - Validates poem structure and coherence

### Fallback Systems

Robust fallback mechanisms ensure the experience continues seamlessly even when external APIs are unavailable:

- **Headline Transformation**: Categorized fallback phrases based on news topics
- **Anchor Generation**: Curated sets of meaningful anchor words
- **Poem Creation**: Template-based poem generation maintaining Skinny structure

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Netlify CLI (for local development with functions)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   netlify dev
   ```

This will start both the Vite development server and Netlify Functions locally.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment

The application is configured for automatic deployment on Netlify. Push to the main branch to trigger a deployment.
