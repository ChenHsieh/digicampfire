## üéØ How It Works

### The Skinny Poem Format

A Skinny poem follows this structure:
- Line 1: Opening whisper (poetic phrase)
- Line 2: Anchor word
- Lines 3-5: Single words
- Line 6: Anchor word (repeated)
- Lines 7-9: Single words
- Line 10: Anchor word (repeated)
- Line 11: Closing whisper (variation of line 1)

### Creation Process

1. **Choose a Whisper**: Select from AI-transformed news headlines
2. **Pick an Anchor**: Choose a word that will anchor your poem
3. **Share Your Feeling**: Optional emotional context
4. **Generate**: AI creates your personalized Skinny poem
